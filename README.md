 - At any time, the user can click the "submit" button. If the password provided meets all the requirements, a green confirmation message will appear. Otherwise, a red error message will appear and prompt the user to try a new password.
 - Users may view their password text by clicking the "Show" checkbox. If the checkbox is unchecked, the password will be hidden.
