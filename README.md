# Features of the App
 - As users type in password input, a section underneath the input will show if the password meets all the validation requirements.
 - At any time, the user can click the "submit" button. If the password provided meets all the requirements, a confirmation message will appear. Otherwise, an error message will appear and prompt the user to try a new password.
 - Users may view their password text by clicking the "Show" checkbox. If the checkbox is unchecked, the password will be hidden.
